üå¶Ô∏è LSTM Weather Prediction (Penang) Overview This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict the weather for Penang. The model is deployed with a Gradio interface, allowing users to input recent weather data and receive predictions for upcoming days.

Features Predicts weather (e.g., temperature, rainfall) for Penang. User-friendly Gradio interface for easy interaction. Built with Python and popular libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Gradio. 
How It Works 
Data Preparation: Historical weather data forPenang is preprocessed and used to train the LSTM model. Model Training: The LSTM model learns temporal patterns in the weather data. Prediction: Users input recent weather data; the model predicts future weather conditions. Gradio App: The web interface lets users interact with the model in real time.
